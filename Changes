Changes
=======

0.01003 - Oct 16 2007
  * Make sure that queries that couldn't be mapped to a backend don't
    get lost. PoCo::Generic doesn't seem to handle multiple calls to
    the same event before returning a response.
  * Add tests for the above
  * Add timeout options which will (attempt to) cancel calls in the backend
    after the timeout has passed
  * Allow alt_fork option, which gets passed to PoCo::Generic
  * Actually store dbh in Backend::DBIC (doh!)
  * Optionally commit the data in Backend::DBIC.

0.01002 - Sep 12 2007
  * Allow debug option, which gets passed to PoCo::Generic
  * Allow cookies to be sent to 'execute'

0.01001 - Sep 12 2007
  * Doc tweaks
  * Add POE::Component::MDBA::Backend::DBIC to execute DBIx::Class queries
    from MDBA.

0.01000 - Sep 11 2007
  * Initial release.
